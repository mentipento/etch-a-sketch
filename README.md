# Etch-A-Sketch

**Etch-A-Sketch** is an interactive browser-based game created as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum. The project focuses on practicing DOM manipulation using JavaScript and creating flexible layouts with CSS Flexbox. Users can define the grid size and see how squares change color when hovered over.

## Project Variants

This project includes three variations:
1. **Main**: Basic version with static coloring.
2. **Random Color**: Squares change to random colors on hover.
3. **Opacity**: Squares darken incrementally with each hover.

The current live version, **Opacity**, is available [here](https://mentipento.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).

## Features

- Dynamic grid size selection (from 2x2 to 100x100 squares).
- Interactive hover effects for square coloring.
- Different game variants demonstrating JavaScript logic and CSS styling.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the basic structure.
- **CSS**: Handles layout with Flexbox and visual styles.
- **JavaScript**: Implements DOM manipulation and event handling.
